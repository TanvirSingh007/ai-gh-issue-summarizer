# GitHub Issue Analyzer

This project uses LangChain to analyze GitHub issue summaries stored as Markdown files. It leverages the DeepSeek R1 model running locally via Ollama for both embeddings and text generation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Ollama installed and running
- DeepSeek R1 model pulled in Ollama

## Setup

1. **Install Ollama** (if not already installed):
   - Visit [Ollama's website](https://ollama.ai/) for installation instructions

2. **Pull the DeepSeek R1 model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-r1
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start Ollama with DeepSeek R1 model**:
   ```bash
   ollama run deepseek-r1
   ```

2. **Run the analyzer**:
   ```bash
   python github_issue_analyzer.py
   ```

The script will:
- Load all Markdown files from the `issue_summaries` folder
- Split documents into manageable chunks
- Create a vector store with embeddings generated by DeepSeek R1
- Set up a RetrievalQA chain for querying
- Run example queries and display the results
- Enter an interactive mode where you can input your own queries

## Example Queries

The script comes with the following example queries:
- "What are the most common themes in these issues?"
- "What is the sentiment of the issue summaries?"
- "Summarize all issues related to bugs."
- "What features are most frequently requested?"
- "Identify any security concerns mentioned in the issues."

You can add more queries by modifying the `EXAMPLE_QUERIES` list in the script.

## Customization

You can customize the following parameters in the script:
- `ISSUE_SUMMARIES_DIR`: Directory containing the Markdown files (default: "issue_summaries")
- `CHUNK_SIZE`: Size of document chunks (default: 1000)
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP`: Overlap between chunks (default: 200)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL`: Ollama model to use (default: "deepseek-r1")
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: URL for Ollama API (default: "http://localhost:11434")
- `PERSIST_DIRECTORY`: Directory to persist the vector database (default: "chroma_db")

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:
- Missing or empty issue_summaries directory
- Ollama connection issues
- Analysis errors

## Adding More Queries

You can easily add more queries by:
1. Running the script
2. When prompted, enter your custom query
3. The script will analyze the GitHub issues based on your query

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter an error connecting to Ollama, make sure it's running with the DeepSeek R1 model
- If no documents are loaded, check that the issue_summaries directory exists and contains Markdown files
